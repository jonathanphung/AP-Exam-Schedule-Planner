 * Unit tests for the verified College Board link map (issue #22, Tier 3).
 *
 * The load-bearing guarantees:
 *   - every shipped subject resolves to a verified official URL (full
 *     coverage — a future subject added without verification fails here, so
 *     the UI's "omit when unverified" branch never silently hides a link);
 *   - no id is guessed: an unknown id resolves to `null`, and the verified
 *     sets contain only real dataset ids (no stale entries).
