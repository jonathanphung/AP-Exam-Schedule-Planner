 * SOURCING RULE (issue #23 AC, PRD §7.5/§8/§11): every `href` here is an official
 * College Board page. The backbone links are the exact URLs already verified in
 * `src/data/sources.md` (fetched 2026-07-04 for the dataset); the AP Students hub
 * and the course/exam index were additionally confirmed live before inclusion.
 * No URL here is guessed, placeholder, or fabricated — if a resource cannot be
 * verified it is omitted rather than shipped broken.
 *
 * Labels may contain the `{cycle}` token, replaced at render time with the
 * dataset's `cycle` (e.g. "May 2026"), so the annual JSON swap re-labels the
 * cycle-specific resources automatically — mirroring the footer and the
 * schedule banner, which also derive their cycle from `apData.cycle`.
